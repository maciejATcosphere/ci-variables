                        Hey Maciej, <br>
                        <br>
                        I'm very glad that you've decided to come to my party! I'm sure it would be amazing. Since you've offered that you could cook how about you collect all ingredients for spring rolls and we prepare them together? If that fine with you please buy. 1-2 carrots, red pepper, cucumber, some mint,
                        <div class="ui label orange">rice noodles<i class="delete icon"></i></div> (the thinner the better) and most important rice spring roll papers, hope it's not too complicated:-).

                        Ah and also maybe some good wine? Red should be good.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I know that you're busy guy but please remember that the party is this Friday at 8 pm, please be on time!
